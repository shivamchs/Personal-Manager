# Personal-Manager
This is a simple app which usses google's firebase authentication to authenticate users and any user can register by giving his E-mail and creating password.
After registering once a user can  store his/her personal data and some private details as passwords for any website or their social  media accounts, contacts and addresses of
any particular places.
This app uses firebase's firestore for storing login credentials of a user so that he/she can login after registering once.
User's private details are secure as these can't be seen without login to the the app.
